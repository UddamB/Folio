# Portfolio Website 



## Description
An aesthetic static portfolio website used for personal resume/CV. 

The current web design includes a red and black theme with responsive buttons and transitions. After creating many different versions of a digital portfolio, I wanted to create one with the perfect blend between complex design and simplicity. Choosing a dark-theme with optimal color choice allowed for seamless flow from one section to another.

The live contact form connects to a google sheet which tracks user inquiries in real time.

Feel free to fork and create your own 'folio!
